**Fullstack engineer from Brazil 🇧🇷**

I design and build scalable systems — from real-time dashboards to mobile apps — using React, Vue, Kotlin, Node.js and Bun.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on:

 • System design and distributed architectures (API orchestration, event-driven flows, caching layers)
 
 • Shared monorepos and reusable component libraries
 
 • Cloud infrastructure with AWS, Docker, and CDK
 
 • CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and performance tuning

I have a postgraduate degree in mobile development at UTFPR. 

I now work as a tutor helping new students navigate the program.
