## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Ryan Machado  
**Fullstack engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·**

I like building things that scale â€” from real-time dashboards to mobile apps â€” using **TypeScript**, **Vue**, **React**, **Kotlin**, and **Java**.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on:

- Shared **monorepos** and component libraries  
- **Cloud infrastructure** with AWS, Docker, and CDK  
- Automating tests, deploys, and all the *boring-but-crucial* stuff

Right now Iâ€™m doing a **postgrad in mobile development** at UTFPR â€” and always looking for better ways to ship fast, clean, and reliable code.
