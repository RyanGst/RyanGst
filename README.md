**Fullstack engineer from Brazil 🇧🇷**

I design and build scalable systems — from real-time dashboards to mobile apps — using React, Vue, Kotlin, Node.js and Bun.

<br/>
Over the past few years, I’ve worked on:

- System design and distributed architectures (API orchestration, event-driven flows, caching layers)
  
- Shared monorepos and reusable component libraries
  
- Cloud infrastructure with AWS, Docker, and CDK
  
- CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and performance tuning

<br/>

I have a postgraduate degree in mobile development at UTFPR. 

I now work as a tutor helping new students navigate the program @ UTFPR
